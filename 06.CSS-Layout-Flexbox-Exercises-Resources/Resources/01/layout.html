                <p class="header">
                    Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who sought to create an ethical system for
                    humans and robots.

                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to
                        harm

                    </h2>


                    <p>
                        A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would
                        conflict with the First Law

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the
                        First or Second Law

                    Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the others. It
                    stated that “a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”
